# Generate SHA1s from Git

You can generate [SHA1][sha1] strings using Git's builtin [`git-hash-object`][git-hash-object]:

```sh
$ echo "Value from the stdin" | git hash-object --stdin
47a90d8e6b2463ccb4ae841100af6212a446a379
```

Unexpected behavior but it can handy, specially if you don't have [`openssl`][openssl] available.

Shout out to [Jacob Clark][jacob-clark] for pointing that out.
