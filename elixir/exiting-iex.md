# Exiting IEx

As most modern languages, [Elixir][elixir] does have a really nice [REPL][repl] called [IEx][iex].  

I'm pretty new to the language myself and after messing around with the interactive shell for a while I tried to quit and... Well... It didn't worked.  
The muscle memory made me go with `Ctrl-C` which did something I didn't wanted and then I naturally tried `Ctrl-D` also without success.

I finally gave up and looked up online which lead me to a [very specific blog post on the subject][plataformatec-blog-post] by the folks at [Plataformatec][plataformatec].

It turns out that the proper way to close it is `Ctrl-\`.
